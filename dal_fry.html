        <b><p class="Recipes-Heading">Follow below Steps to make tasty dal fry</p></b><br> 
        <p><b>Step1: </b>Rinse your lentils in water for 3 to 4 times. I would recommend using ½ cup tur dal (arhar dal or pigeon pea lentils) or ¼ cup each of tuvar dal and masoor dal (pink or orange lentils).</p><br> 
        <p><b>Step 2:</b>Pressure cook the dal for 5-6 whistles with water, salt and turmeric powder. Wait for the pressure to release naturally. Once done, open the lid and set it aside. Drain and reserve the water.</p><br> 
        <p><b>Step 3: </b>Heat oil and ghee in a kadhai. Once hot, add the grated ginger, garlic and green chillies to it.</p><br> 
        <p><b>Step 4:</b>Saute for a few seconds and add the chopped onion. Saute for another 3-4 minutes till onions are soft and golden brown in colour.</p><br> 
        <p><b>Step 5:</b>Once done add the tomatoes to it and let it cook for 2 minutes till the tomatoes are soft and mushy.<br>After the tomatoes are soft add the cooked lentils to the masala and give it a good mix.<br>Add 1 cup of the reserved lentil water to it, adjust salt accordingly.</p><br> 
        <p><b>Step 6:</b>Let the dal come to a boil, then simmer for 10 mins till it reaches the desired consistency. Add water as and when needed to reach the consistency you prefer. I prefer it a little thicker.</p>
        <p>The next step is to temper the dal. Heat ghee/clarified butter in a small tadka pan. Once hot, add the cumin seeds, fennel seeds and mustard seeds and dry red chillies, followed by the hing and red chilli powder. Fry for 15 secs till everything has popped and is fragrant. Make sure that you do not burn them. </p><br> 
        <p><b>Step 7: </b>Pour the tadka on the dal. Rest the dal fry for 10 mins before giving it a stir and serve. Serve hot, garnished with coriander leaves and a squeeze of lemon juice.</p><br>
        <p><b>Step 8: </b>Serve Dal Fry Recipe with Steamed Rice Recipe or jeera rice or Phulka and Aloo Methi Masala Recipe for a delicious meal.</p><br>
